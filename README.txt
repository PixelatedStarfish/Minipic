Minipic is a little python app I wrote to showcase pictures. When you have a bunch of pictures it can be easy to start overlooking stuff. Minipic gets a random set of pictures and displays them. It keeps a big collection fresh and interesting.

Minipic can display between 1 and 25 images, and it comes with a selection of pictures I took while birding.
You can open the Images folder and add, move, or delete what you like. Be sure to back up your stuff somewhere.

Minipic is open source, and written in python3 with tkinter.
